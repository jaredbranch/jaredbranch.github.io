# Lab

I am actively recruiting motivated students to join my laboratory. As a member of the laboratory, you will gain experience collecting and analyzing data, writing in APA, and designing research projects. These skills are important to obtain if you plan to attend graduate school. I am especially interested in mentoring students whose goals include publishing peer-reviewed articles.

If you are interested in joining the lab, please [send me an email](mailto:Jared.Branch@Avila.edu)
