# Lab

I am actively recruiting motivated students to join my laboratory. As a member of the laboratory, you will gain experience collecting and analyzing data, writing in APA style, and designing research projects. I am especially interested in mentoring students who wish to present their work at conferences and/or as peer-reviewed articles. 

If you are interested in joining the lab, please [send me an email](mailto:Jared.Branch@Avila.edu).

## Current Lab Projects
* Learning & memory in virtual reality
* The phenomenological characteristics of episodic memory
* Simulating episodic future thoughts and episodic counterfactual thoughts
* Clinical applications of virtual reality and episodic memory
* Large-scale collaborative replication projects
