# Lab

I am actively recruiting motivated undergraduate and graduate students to join my laboratory. As a member of the laboratory, you will gain experience collecting and analyzing data, writing in APA style, and designing research projects. I am especially interested in mentoring students who wish to present their work at conferences and/or as peer-reviewed articles. 

If you are interested in joining the lab, please [send me an email](mailto:Jared.Branch@Avila.edu).

## Current Lab Projects
* Virtual Reality assisted Mental Time Travel
* The [phenomenological](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/) characteristics of episodic memory, episodic future thoughts, and episodic counterfactual thoughts
* Therapeutic and clinical applications of Mental Time Travel
