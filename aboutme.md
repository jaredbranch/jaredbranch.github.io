# About Me

## Education
* Ph.D. Bowling Green State University 2017 - 2020
* M.A. Bowling Green State University 2014 - 2017

I am an assistant professor of [cognitive science](http://catalog.avila.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=1836) at Avila University.

I have three main lines of inquiry that drive my research:
1. How autobiographical memory allows for imagining the future and how our past could have been different.
2. Classroom interventions that can improve students' critical thinking skills. 
3. Collaborative, large-scale replication projects.
