# About Me

I am an assistant professor of [cognitive science](http://catalog.avila.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=1836) at Avila University.

I have three main lines of research:
1. I am interested in questions related to how our autobiographical memory system allows us to imagine the future or imagine how the past could have been different. I explore these questions via virtual reality.
2. I am interested in how students learn and classroom interventions that can improve critical thinking skills. 
3. I am interested in contributing to replication projects.
