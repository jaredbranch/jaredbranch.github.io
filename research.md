# Research

## Memory

I am interested in how the constructive nature of our autobiographical memory system allows for the imagining of future scenarios and alternative scenarios to the past (also known as <em>Mental Time Travel</em>).

## Pedagogy
My research in learning centers around pedagogical interventions that can improve learning outcomes, such as critical thinking and skepticism.
