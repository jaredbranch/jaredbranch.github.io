# Research

## Memory

I am interested in how the constructive nature of our autobiographical memory system allows allows for the imagining of future scenarios and alternative scenarios to the past. I study the how the structure of our conscious experience differs when we are remembering the past, simulating the future, and simulating a counterfactual past.

## Learning

As it pertains to learning, I am specifically interested in pedagogical interventions that can improve learning outcomes, such as the ability to think more critically and skeptically.
