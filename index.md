Members of the Cog Sci Lab at [Avila University](https://www.avila.edu/) seek to better understand the mind by asking questions about memory, mental time travel, counterfactual thinking, and pedagogy. We answer these questions using the methods of psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields of [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science). You can learn more about the degree program [here](https://www.avila.edu/program/cognitive-science/).
